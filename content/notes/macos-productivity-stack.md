# macOS Productivity Stack: Stream Deck, Raycast & CleanShot

After optimizing my macOS workflow for years, I've settled on a three-tool stack that dramatically improves development productivity: Stream Deck for automation, Raycast for quick actions, and CleanShot for documentation.

## Stream Deck: Physical Automation

### Development Workflows

```javascript
// Coming soon: Stream Deck button configurations
// for common development tasks
```

### Project Switching

```bash
# Coming soon: Automated project switching
# with environment setup and window management
```

### Build and Deploy Automation

```yaml
# Coming soon: One-button build and deployment
# configurations for different environments
```

## Raycast: Lightning-Fast Actions

### Custom Commands

```bash
# Coming soon: Custom Raycast commands
# for development workflow optimization
```

### Extensions Ecosystem

- **GitHub integration**: PR management and issue tracking
- **Linear integration**: Quick issue creation and updates
- **Clipboard history**: Advanced clipboard management
- **Window management**: Precise window positioning

### Workflow Automation

```typescript
// Coming soon: Raycast workflow scripts
// for complex multi-step operations
```

## CleanShot: Documentation Excellence

### Screenshot Workflows

```bash
# Coming soon: CleanShot configurations
# for consistent documentation screenshots
```

### Annotation Patterns

```markdown
<!-- Coming soon: Annotation best practices
     for technical documentation -->
```

### Integration with Documentation

```typescript
// Coming soon: Automated screenshot integration
// with documentation workflows
```

## Synergy Between Tools

### Unified Workflows

```bash
# Coming soon: How these tools work together
# to create seamless productivity workflows
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

```json
// Coming soon: Optimized keyboard shortcut
// configurations that avoid conflicts
```

## Advanced Configurations

### Environment-Specific Setups

```bash
# Coming soon: Different configurations
# for work, personal, and client projects
```

### Backup and Sync

```bash
# Coming soon: Configuration backup strategies
# and sync across multiple machines
```

## Productivity Metrics

### Measuring Impact

- **Task completion time reduction**
- **Context switching frequency**
- **Documentation quality improvement**
- **Automation success rates**
