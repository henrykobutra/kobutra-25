# MCP Integrations: Supercharging Development Workflow

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a paradigm shift in how AI assistants interact with development tools. Here's how to leverage MCP integrations for maximum productivity.

## Understanding MCP Architecture

### Core Concepts

```typescript
// Coming soon: MCP server architecture
// and integration patterns
```

## Essential MCP Servers

### Development Workflow Servers

- **Linear MCP**: Project management integration
- **Supabase MCP**: Direct database access
- **ESLint MCP**: Code quality automation
- **Context7 MCP**: Documentation retrieval

## Custom MCP Server Development

### Building Your Own Integrations

```typescript
// Coming soon: Step-by-step guide to creating
// custom MCP servers for your specific needs
```

## Workflow Automation Patterns

### AI-Driven Development Cycles

```bash
# Coming soon: Automated workflows that leverage
# multiple MCP servers for seamless development
```

## Security and Best Practices

### Safe MCP Integration

```typescript
// Coming soon: Security considerations
// and best practices for MCP deployments
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### Production Examples

- **Automated code reviews** with context awareness
- **Database schema evolution** with AI assistance
- **Project management** synchronized with code changes
